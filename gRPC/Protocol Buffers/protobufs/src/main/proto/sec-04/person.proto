/*
  The numbers in Protocol Buffers (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4 in your Person message) are called field tags.
  They uniquely identify each field in the binary encoding.
  These tags are used during serialization and deserialization to map data to the correct fields, ensuring backward and forward compatibility.
  Changing a tag number can break compatibility, so they should remain stable once assigned. The objective is to optimize the size of the encoded data while maintaining clarity and structure.
  For instance if you use numbers between 1 to 15, they take one byte to encode, while numbers between 16 to 2047 take two bytes.
